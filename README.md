## Implementation and Code structure

The project was developed with React, and consists of an App component that renders (a) the theme switch button, (b) the MainDashboard and (c) the TagBoard. The App component also holds the ThemeContext used to switch the theme, and for it's props to be accessible from any other components within the app without prop drilling.

The MainDashboard renders: a Header with only the title and subtitle (although in a larget app it could also serve navigation pourposes); and the grid of card components with the data provided from the design.

The TagBoard renders a grid of tag components populates with the data from the design.
